 IP Validation Project

This Java project, named `IPValidation`, provides a simple tool to validate IPv4 addresses. It checks whether the given input is a valid IPv4 address or not, considering the format and range of octets.

 Usage

1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac IPValidation.java
   ```

2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   java IPValidation
   ```

3. Enter the IPv4 address when prompted.

Input Validation

The program validates the entered IPv4 address based on the following criteria:

- It checks if the address has four octets.
- It ensures that each octet is within the valid range of 0 to 255.
- It identifies and reports specific issues if found, such as leading zeros or non-numeric characters.

Example

```java
public class IPValidation {
    // ... (Existing code)

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ... (Existing code)

        if (isValid(ipToBeValidated)) {
            System.out.println(ipToBeValidated + " is valid");
        } else {
            System.out.println(ipToBeValidated + " is invalid" + reasonForInvalidation(invalidId));
        }
    }

    // ... (Existing code)
}
```
